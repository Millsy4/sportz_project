# Sportzilla: NBA Player Statistics 


## Overview
### Welcome to our project! Our team has created a responsive website that provides statistics from the 2019-2020 NBA season for each user-searched player. This was achieved by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.


## Technologies Used Include: 
* ### Foundation CSS
* ### Javascript
* ### JQuery
* ### HTML

# The server-side APIs used in this project include:
* [balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction)
* [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)

# Direction for Future Development
> Using this website we have created we would like for it to include other sports and for it to include the teams and live scores.
