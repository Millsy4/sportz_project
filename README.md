# Sportzilla: NBA Player Statistics 


## Overview
Welcome to our project! Our team has created a responsive website that provides statistics from the 2019-2020 NBA season for each user-searched player. This was achieved by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

The server-side APIs used in this project include:
* [balldontlie](https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction)
* [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php)
